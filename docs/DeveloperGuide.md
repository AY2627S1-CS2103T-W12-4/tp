# RecruitDex Developer Guide

<!-- * Table of Contents -->
<page-nav-print />

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Overview**

RecruitDex helps recruiters rank applicants through a series of side-by-side comparisons. Instead of placing every applicant in a complete ranking at once, a recruiter chooses which of two applicants is stronger, and RecruitDex updates the ranking as decisions are made. Recruiters can review the full ranking of applicants in the active comparison list and use it to inform hiring decisions.

The workflow has three distinct parts:

1. **Manage applicant records.** Add applicants and maintain details such as names, contact information, and interview notes. Records can be edited or deleted.
2. **Manage the active comparison list.** Add or remove applicants from the set to be ranked. Adding an applicant record and adding that applicant to the comparison list are separate operations in the system, even if the interface offers them together.
3. **Compare applicants.** Open the comparison view, review the two applicants RecruitDex presents, and choose the stronger one. The ranking updates immediately so the recruiter can see the effect of each decision.

These parts can be revisited as recruitment progresses. An applicant must have a record before joining the comparison list and must join the list before being compared, but recruiters can compare existing applicants before adding more. RecruitDex is designed for command-line input, with a graphical interface primarily for displaying applicants, comparisons, and ranking changes.

## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

The following provides a quick overview of the main components and their interactions.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* provides its functionality through a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class that implements the corresponding API interface.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in `Logic.java` and implements it in `LogicManager.java`. Other components interact with a component through its interface rather than its concrete class, preventing them from coupling to that component's implementation, as illustrated in the following partial class diagram.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` and its parts, such as `CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ApplicantListPanel`, and `StatusBarFooter`. All of these, including `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class, which captures common behavior among classes that represent visible GUI parts.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFX UI framework. The layouts of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files in `src/main/resources/view`. For example, [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml) specifies the layout of [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java).

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component because it displays `Applicant` objects from the model.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X), but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>


How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, the command is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object, which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete an applicant).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above for simplicity, the code can require several interactions between the command object and the `Model` to complete the operation.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name, e.g., `AddCommandParser`). The parser uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create an `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`). The `AddressBookParser` returns that object as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes, such as `AddCommandParser` and `DeleteCommandParser`, implement the `Parser` interface so they can be treated similarly where appropriate, for example during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="650" />


The `Model` component,

* stores applicant records in `AddressBook` through a `UniqueApplicantList`. The model package also contains `ApplicantRegistry`, an in-memory collection where `add(Applicant)` returns a generated UUID and `get(UUID)` retrieves the corresponding applicant. The registry is not yet integrated with commands, the UI, or JSON storage.
* stores the `Applicant` objects selected by the current filter, such as search results, in a separate _filtered_ list. It exposes this list as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Applicant>` that the UI can observe and bind to, so the UI updates when the list changes.
* stores a `UserPrefs` object that represents the user’s preferences (currently, just the GUI settings). This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPrefs` object.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The alternative, arguably more object-oriented, design below keeps a unique list of tags in `AddressBook`, and each `Applicant` references tags from that list. This lets `AddressBook` maintain one `Tag` object per unique tag instead of each `Applicant` holding its own `Tag` objects.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />
</box>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* is implemented by `StorageManager`, which delegates the actual JSON file access to `JsonAddressBookStorage` and `JsonUserPrefsStorage` (one class per data file).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` -- Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` -- Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState0.puml" alt="UndoRedoState0" />

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th applicant in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState1.puml" alt="UndoRedoState1" />

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David …​` to add a new applicant. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState2.puml" alt="UndoRedoState2" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.
</box>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the applicant was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState3.puml" alt="UndoRedoState3" />


<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.
</box>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X), but due to a limitation of PlantUML, it continues to the end of the diagram.
</box>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Model" />

The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.
</box>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState4.puml" alt="UndoRedoState4" />

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David …` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState5.puml" alt="UndoRedoState5" />

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<puml src="diagrams/CommitActivityDiagram.puml" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo execute:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the applicant being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command is correct.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

* recruits for software engineering roles and manages many applicants
* needs to compare applicants and explain how a shortlist was reached
* prefers desktop apps over other types of applications
* can type fast
* prefers typing to mouse interactions
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

**Value proposition**:

RecruitDex helps recruiters make more systematic, reviewable hiring decisions by building a ranking from individual applicant comparisons.

* **Easier decisions:** Choosing between two applicants at a time is simpler than ordering the entire applicant pool in one sitting. Recruiters can make progress over multiple sessions and see the ranking evolve.
* **Less impact from a mistaken judgment:** One comparison need not permanently fix an applicant's position; further comparisons can provide more evidence and change the ranking.
* **Clearer oversight:** Recruitment managers can inspect the comparisons behind a ranking, require a minimum number of comparisons, and compare recruiters' decisions to identify possible anomalies.


### User stories

Priorities: High (must have) - `* * *`, Medium (nice to have) - `* *`, Low (unlikely to have) - `*`.

These stories describe the requirements backlog, including ideas considered for future development; they do not indicate which features are currently implemented. High-priority stories support the core applicant-management and comparison workflow. Medium-priority stories improve convenience or reviewability, while low-priority stories are optional extensions.

An applicant record stores an applicant's details. The active comparison list is the set of applicants currently being ranked; removing an applicant from this list does not delete their record.

| Priority | As a …                                          | I can …                                                                                      | So that I can …                                                                     |

### Glossary

- **Active Comparison List:** The set of applicant records currently included in the ranking process. Removing an applicant from this list does not delete their applicant record.

- **Applicant Record:** The stored information associated with an applicant, including their name, contact information, and interview notes.

- **API (Application Programming Interface):** An interface that defines how other components can interact with a component without needing to know its internal implementation.

- **Command:** An operation requested by the user through the command-line interface, such as adding, deleting, or comparing applicants.

- **Command Parser:** A component that interprets a user's command input and converts it into the corresponding Command object.

- **Command-Line Interface (CLI):** The text-based interface through which users enter commands to interact with RecruitDex.

- **Command Result:** An object representing the outcome of executing a command. It is returned by the Logic component after a command has been processed.

- **Comparison:** A decision made by a recruiter between two applicants presented by RecruitDex. The selected applicant is considered stronger for that comparison.

- **Comparison View:** The part of the user interface that presents two applicants side by side for the recruiter to compare.

- **Component:** A major architectural part of RecruitDex. The main components are UI, Logic, Model, and Storage, with Commons containing classes shared across components.

- **Filtered List:** A list maintained by the Model containing applicants that satisfy the current filtering criteria. The UI observes this list to update the displayed applicants.

- **JavaFX:** The Java framework used by RecruitDex to implement its graphical user interface.

- **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation):** A text-based data format used by RecruitDex to store applicant data and user preferences.

- **Logic:** The component responsible for interpreting and executing user commands.

- **Mainstream OS:** Windows, Linux, Unix, or macOS

- **Main Success Scenario (MSS):** The normal sequence of steps in a use case where the user achieves the intended outcome without encountering an error or exception.

- **Model:** The component responsible for maintaining RecruitDex's application data in memory, including applicant records and user preferences.

- **Ranking:** The ordered list of applicants in the active comparison list, based on the outcomes of comparisons.

- **RecruitDex:** The application that helps recruiters manage applicants and produce a ranking through pairwise comparisons.

- **Storage:** The component responsible for saving RecruitDex's data to persistent storage and loading it when the application starts.

- **Use Case (UC):** A description of how a user interacts with RecruitDex to accomplish a particular goal, including the normal sequence of actions and possible extensions or errors.

- **User Interface (UI):** The component responsible for displaying RecruitDex's graphical interface and receiving user commands.

- **User Preferences:** Settings associated with the user, such as GUI-related settings, that are stored separately from applicant data.

- **Versioned Address Book:** The mechanism described in the proposed undo/redo implementation for maintaining previous states of the application's data so that earlier states can be restored.

- **Undo/Redo:** Functionality that allows a user to reverse a previous change or restore a change that was previously undone.
